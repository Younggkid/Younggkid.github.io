Hi! I’m Chenyang Liu, a first-year PhD student at Duke University, currently working with [Prof. Matt Lentz](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~mlentz/) and [Prof. Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/). My research interests lie at the intersection of blockchain and confidential computing. If you share similar interests, feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!

Before joining Duke, I completed my undergraduate studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Guoxing Chen](https://donnod.github.io). My research there focused on cache side-channel mitigation and TEE design.
